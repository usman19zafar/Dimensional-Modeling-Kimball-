From grain clarity to conformed dimensions, Section 1.2 gives you the blueprint to architect analytics that scale, govern history, and speak the language of business.

Write‑Up
Section 1.2 distills Kimball’s dimensional modeling into a practical playbook for analytics excellence. 
We’ll learn to design star schemas that simplify complexity, choose the right SCD strategy to balance agility with history, define fact table grain for precision, and build conformed dimensions that unify every domain.

This section equips us with clear analogies, step‑by‑step architectures, and interview‑ready summaries, making it both a curriculum artifact and a career accelerator.

Dimensional modeling is more than design—it’s the language of business intelligence. 
Mastering it means turning raw data into trusted dashboards, consistent metrics, and scalable analytics. 
Section 1.2 positions us as a "DATA STORY TELLER", shaping insights that resonate across the enterprise.
